`HibuNode Dashboard` is a lightweight explorer for Cosmos-based Blockchains. Visit it at: https://explorer.hibunode.com .

## What sets HibuNode Dashboard apart from other explorers?
**HibuNode Dashboard** stands out by providing a real-time exploration of blockchain data without relying on caching or pre-processing. It exclusively fetches data from the Cosmos full node via LCD/RPC endpoints, ensuring a truly authentic experience. This approach is referred to as the "Light Explorer."

## Are you interested in listing your blockchain on https://explorer.hibunode.com?

To keep this repository clean, please submit your request to [HibuNode GitHub](https://github.com/brkcinar/explorer).

## Why does HibuNode Dashboard rely on official/trusted third-party public LCD/RPC servers?
There are two primary reasons for this choice:

- **Trust:** In a decentralized system, it is crucial to avoid relying solely on a single entity. By utilizing official/trusted third-party public LCD/RPC servers, HibuNode Dashboard ensures that the data is sourced from a network of trusted participants.
- **Limited Resources:** As HibuNode Dashboard plans to list multiple Cosmos-based blockchains in the future, it is impractical for the HibuNode team to operate validators or full nodes for all of them. Leveraging trusted third-party servers allows for more efficient resource allocation.
